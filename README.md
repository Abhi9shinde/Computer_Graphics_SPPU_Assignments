## Assignment 1: Line Drawing Algorithms 

Implement **DDA** and **Bresenham** line drawing algorithms to draw:
1. **Simple line**
2. **Dotted line**
3. **Dashed line**
4. **Solid line** using mouse interface.

### Requirements:
- Divide the screen into four quadrants with the center at (0, 0).
- The line should work for all slopes: +ve, -ve, >1, <1.
